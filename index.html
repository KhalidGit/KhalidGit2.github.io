<p>I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin,
with an expected graduation date in Fall 2016. I have a variety of interests including mechanical design,
software design and implementation, web development and much more. I believe programming and computational skills
are key tools for all engineers to have and will be essential to the emerging mathematical and computational economy.
It is for this reason that I am supplementing my mechanical engineering degree by studying computer science to earn 
a Computer Science Certificate through the Elements of Computing program in the Department of Computer Science. 
I believe my technical knowledge of mechanical engineering combined with my technological skills and passion for innovation
give me the capabilities to play an integral part in an engineering team and succeed in a technical engineering role. 
I am an extremely self driven and motivated individual. 
I aspire to complete any task brought before me and will always seek out new challenges. </br>
Congrats on making it through that ^ jeez.. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/C9fcwLF.jpg">Here's</a> a cat for your trouble.
